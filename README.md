# ðŸ§ White Blood Cell Detection and Classification using YOLO

This repository contains a detailed Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of training a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for detecting and classifying white blood cells. The notebook is part of the Trusttii Competition and includes comprehensive steps for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features:

- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, augmentation, and normalization of the dataset to ensure high-quality inputs for the YOLO model.
- **Model Training**: Step-by-step guide on training the YOLO model, including manual checkpointing for performance tuning.
- **Evaluation**: Techniques for evaluating the model's performance and saving the trained model for future use.
